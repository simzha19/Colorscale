# Colorscale
Python project using Pillow to convert an image into a "colorscale image". Similar to how greyscale converts the image to shades of grey, this script converts it into shades of a color of your choosing

##How to Use
- Place your images into /Images/Original
- Run terminalize.py
- Greyscale images will be saved into /Images/Greyscale
- Colorscale images will be saved into /Images/Colorscale

##To-do List
- User interface that can select colors from a color wheel rather than manually entering the RGB values in code
- Faster implementation time - it currently takes 45-60 seconds to run for one picture
